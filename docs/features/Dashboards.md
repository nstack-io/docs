> Example of a dashboard

The **Dashboard** feature provides a real time overview of one or more apps that are launched/opened by users. `(visualization of one or more apps that are being opened by the users.)`

The **Dashboard** is only accessable from the NStack web console. It does not have any counter part in the provided SDKs.

As it can be seen from the example, several apps are depicted when they are opened and where in the world they are opened from. Additionally, over the map, different graphs can be placed:

* iOS version distribution over a certain period(s) of time
* Android version distribution over a certain period(s) of time
* iOS vs. Android distribution over a certain period(s) of time
* App openings over a certain period(s) of time

The graphs can be added from the **Visualization** section. 

By creating a **Dashboard**, only the map and app(s) openings are shown. The location of the app openings is taken by IP address, since NStack does not have location services implemented.
